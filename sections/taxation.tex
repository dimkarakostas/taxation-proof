Attacks:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Collusion between exchange and user
    \item Need external intervention by tax authority:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Exchange refuses to run address verification protocol
            \item Exchange refuses to sign protocol transcript
            \item Exchange signs transcript and immediately changes $L, Y$ \comment{solution: time-delayed changes?}
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
