A holistic approach regarding auditable ledgers is zkLedger by Narula
\etal~\cite{EPRINT:NarVasVir18}. The taxable ledger of
Section~\ref{sec:taxchain} defines a ledger which by design enables audits and
taxation, although our approach is much simpler than zkLedger regarding the
changes needed in existing designs in order to accommodate taxation. Our second
solution builds upon and extends existing research on proofs of solvency. The
first such scheme for Bitcoin exchanges, proposed by
Maxwell~\cite{wilcox2014proving}, leaks the total amount of both assets and
liabilities of the exchange. More importantly, it enables an attack that allows
the exchange to hide assets, as detailed by Doerner \etal in
Zeroledge~\cite{doernerzeroledge}, which also proposed a privacy-preserving
system that allows exchanges to prove properties about their holdings.
Provisions, by Dagher \etal~\cite{CCS:DBBCB15}, is also a proof of solvency
mechanism for Bitcoin exchanges based on Sigma protocols, which allows
exchanges to prove solvency in zero-knowledge, \ie without the need to reveal
the addresses or the amount of assets that it controls. Similarly, Agrawal
\etal~\cite{C:AgrGanMoh18} describe a proof of solvency using SNARKS, achieving
better performance compared to Provisions, although assuming a trusted setup;
this work enables proof of solvency for not only pay-to-public-key, but also
pay-to-public-key-hash addresses, the most common type of Bitcoin addresses.
Our mechanism of Section~\ref{sec:provisions-extension} is an extension to
Provisions, though is also applicable to Agrawal \etal
