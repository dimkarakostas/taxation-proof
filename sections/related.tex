The main area of research which touches our paper is the proof of solvency line
of work. The first proof of solvency scheme for Bitcoin exchanges was proposed
by Maxwell~\cite{wilcox2014proving}. However, this scheme leaks the total
amount of both assets and liabilities of the exchange, while, more importantly,
enabling an attack that allows the exchange to hide assets, as detailed by
Doerner \etal in Zeroledge~\cite{doernerzeroledge}; this work also proposed a
proof system by which exchanges can prove properties about their holdings
without revealing sensitive information.

The work upon which we build is Provisions~\cite{CCS:DBBCB15} by Dagher \etal
Provisions is a privacy-preserving proof of solvency for Bitcoin exchanges.
Based on a number of Sigma protocols, Provisions allows exchanges to prove
solvency in zero-knowledge, \ie without the need to reveal the addresses or the
amount of assets that it controls. Additionally, Agrawal
\etal~\cite{C:AgrGanMoh18} describe a proof of solvency using SNARKS, thus
achieving better performance compared to Provisions, although assuming a
trusted setup. Our work provides an extension to Provisions, although it can be
easily applied to the work of Agrawal \etal as well.
