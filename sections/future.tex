\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

The current paper focuses on the issue of mainstream adoption of decentralized
blockchain assets, specifically tackling the problem of taxation of
crypto-assets. After identifying the requirements, as well as the inherent
limitations, of such mechanisms, we construct a scheme building on the
well-known Provisions mechanism for the auditing of the solvency of
crypto-exchanges.

Our mechanism, although enabling a user to identify whether the assets they
receive from an exchange have been properly taxed, is constrained in a number
of ways. First, as described in Section~\ref{sec:taxation}, our mechanism is
more effective as more users utilize it. However, our design lacks incentives
which would motivate a user to use it. Second, although proving the tax evasion
to a third party in the standard setting is impossible, perhaps stronger
assumptions could lead to more optimistic results. For instance, if every
exchange was require to use specially-crafted addresses, then it could be
possible that a user who identifies a tax evasion incident be able to report it
(including a proof) to the authority. Future work will explore such designs, as
well as all privacy implications.
