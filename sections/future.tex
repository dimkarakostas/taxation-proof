\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

Potential attacks that are not solved by our scheme:
\begin{itemize}
    \item exchange refuses to run address verification protocol
    \item exchange refuses to sign protocol transcript
    \item exchange signs transcript and immediately changes $L, Y$ \comment{solution: time-delayed changes?}
\end{itemize}

Usability problems:
\begin{itemize}
    \item smart contract requires intervention by taxation authority
    \item smart contract locks while tax authority is investigating, does not allow/reward multiple violation submissions
    \item how to identify the deposit amount
\end{itemize}
