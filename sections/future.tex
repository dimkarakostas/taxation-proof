\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

This work aims to make the problem of facilitating cryptocurrency taxation
concrete and accelerate the discussion around it. In doing so we identified a
number of limitations and desiderata of such mechanisms and presented two basic
taxation designs which act as a stepping stone for more concrete solutions.
Future work will formalize the discussion in the form of definitions and
impossibility results, as well as explore robust constructions of taxable
ledgers. Points of interest will be the overhead of the freezing
on user experience and the storage requirements of the taxation authority,
as well as incentive schemes to motivate the adoption of taxation and reduce
dependence on enforcement by the authorities.
