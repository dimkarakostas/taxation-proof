\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

Our paper aims to accelerate the discussion regarding taxation of
crypto-assets. Both presented designs face a number of limitations, which will
be explored in future work. Specifically, we will explore concrete
constructions of the taxable ledger, in order to evaluate the overhead of the
asset freezing on the system and clearly define the system's parameters, \eg
the duration of the taxation period. Also our designs could be
extended with incentives that motivate their adoption, instead of relying on
the enforcement of the taxation policy by the authorities.
