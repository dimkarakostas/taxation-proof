\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

Taxation mechanisms for decentralized blockchains and cryptocurrencies has
fairly sidelined in existing research literature. Given the importance of
taxation in the widespread adoption of such systems, this work aims to make the
problem of facilitating cryptocurrency taxation concrete and accelerate the
discussion around it. In doing so we identified a number of limitations and
desiderata of such mechanisms and presented two basic taxation designs, which
will act as a stepping stone for more concrete solutions.

Future work will focus on formalizing the discussion, offering concrete
definitions and impossibility results, as well as explore robust constructions
of taxable ledgers. Particular points of interest will be the effect that
freezing has on user experience, as well as the storage requirements of the
taxation authority. Finally, an interesting research direction will be the
design of incentive schemes that motivate the adoption of taxation and reduce
dependence on enforcement by the taxation authorities.
