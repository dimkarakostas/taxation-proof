\subsection{Desiderata}\label{sec:taxation}

Our goal is to design a mechanism which helps authorities identify tax evasion
for assets maintained via a distributed ledger.

In such systems, a user $\user$ manages their assets via addresses. Each
address $\address$ is associated with a key pair $\keypair$, such that the
private key $\signkey$ is used to claim ownership of the assets, \eg by signing
special messages; typically $\address = \hash(\verifykey)$ for some hash
function $\hash$. Each address $\address$ is associated with a (public) balance
$\balance(\address)$ so, given a list $[\address_1, \dots, \address_n]$ of all
addresses that $\user$ controls, $\user$'s total assets are $\assets =
\sum_{i=1}^n \balance(\address_i)$. Our goal will be to retain as much privacy
as possible, so $\assets$ should be the only information that is leaked to
$\taxAuth$, without additional de-anonymization data that pertain to specific
transactions.

To showcase the limitations of current systems, consider the following example.
Assume that Alice tax evades, \ie creates a secret, undeclared address
$\address$ and controls some assets $\asset$ in it. Given the pseudonymous
nature of the ledger, $\address$ cannot be correlated with Alice, until she
uses it. Following, Alice issues a transaction $\tau$ which sends $\theta$
assets from $\address$ to Bob. If Bob suspects that Alice evaded taxation for
these $\theta$ assets, they might want to report her to the authorities for
inspection. However, the complaint should be accompanied by a proof that
$\address$ is controlled by Alice, \ie a proof that Alice knows the private key
associated with $\address$. This is necessary as $\taxAuth$ needs to
distinguish between two scenarios:
\begin{inparaenum}[i)]
    \item Alice controls $\address$ and tax evades;
    \item Bob is lying about Alice owning $\address$.
\end{inparaenum}
In the first scenario, Bob \emph{does} know that $\address$ is controlled by
Alice, but $\tau$ is not sufficient to prove it.
Instead, Bob needs a proof which can only be supplied by Alice, \eg a signature
from Alice which acknowledges $\tau$ or $\address$. However, if Alice tax
evades, naturally she would not create such incriminating proof.

The core goal is to help authorities identify tax
evasion. However, it is important that we retain as many good features of
existing ledger systems as possible, such as transaction privacy. Our scheme is
aimed at pseudonymous, Bitcoin-like levels of privacy, while minimizing the
information leaked to the authorities during a taxation investigation.  Another
important aspect is the mechanism's performance. A fundamental ingredient of
payment systems is the seamless transaction experience, so it is important to
allow users to transact at all times, while also avoiding significant strain
during taxation periods. Finally, our mechanisms aim to minimize the amount of
(additional) data which are published to the ledger, since storage in
distributed ledgers is particularly costly.

In conclusion, the desiderata of a taxation mechanism are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Tax evasion identification}: Tax evasion, \ie failure of a
        user $\user$ to declare the amount of assets they own, should be either
        detectable by a taxation authority $\taxAuth$ with access to the
        ledger.
    \item \textbf{High level of privacy}: $\taxAuth$ should --- at most ---
        learn the total amount of assets owned by each taxpayer at the end of a
        fiscal year; this information should be leaked only to $\taxAuth$ and
        no additional information should be leaked to any other party, apart
        from the information already published on the ledger.
    \item \textbf{Unobstructed operation}: The introduction of a taxation
        mechanism should not result in any period during which the --- tax
        compliant --- users are prohibited from transacting.
    \item \textbf{Low performance overhead}: The taxation mechanism should not
        introduce a major performance overhead, in terms of computation and
        storage requirements from the users and the taxation authority.
    \item \textbf{Balanced load}: The computation and storage overhead of
        taxation should be spread over a period of time, rather than introduce
        performance spikes.
\end{itemize}
