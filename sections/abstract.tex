    In this work, we discuss the problem of facilitating tax auditing in
    distributed ledger-based currency systems. We explore how a taxation
    authority can verify the declared returns of its citizens and describe two
    such techniques. First, we describe a design which enable auditing it as a
    built-in feature with minimal changes on the underlying ledger's consensus
    protocol. Second, we offer an application-layer extension, which requires
    no modification in the underlying ledger's design. Both solutions provide a
    high level of privacy, ensuring that, apart from specific limited data
    given to the taxation authority, no additional information --- beyond the
    information already published on the underlying ledger --- is leaked.
