    A major bottleneck against the widespread adoption and usage of
    decentralized blockchain systems is the distance between the needs of the
    enterprises and the regulatory bodies. A primary example of this tension is
    the trade-off between user privacy and the taxation of cryptocurrency
    assets. In this work we explore the taxation space of cryptocurrency
    exchanges and define a mechanism, which enables exchanges to retain the
    privacy of their users and assets, while cooperating with a taxation
    authority in order to be compliant. We implement the taxation mechanism by
    building on the existing Provisions scheme and show that it can be easily
    deployed by cryptocurrency exchanges.
