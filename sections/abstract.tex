    In this work we discuss the problem of facilitating taxation mechanisms in
    cryptocurrency systems. We identify the required properties of such
    mechanisms, including preserving privacy and tax evasion protection, and
    outline the challenges of implementing taxation in existing
    cryptocurrencies. We describe two techniques to
    realise taxation. First, we describe a ledger which enables taxation as a built-in
    feature. This is achieved via only small changes in existing ledger
    designs. Second, we describe an extension which can be built on
    top of most existing cryptocurrencies without any modification in the
    underlying ledger. Both solutions provide a high level of privacy ensuring
    that no other information (beyond the information which is already leaked
    by the underlying ledger) is leaked to any party except for a taxation
    authority, which learns the total amount of a user's assets that are to be
    taxed.
