\begin{abstract}
    In this work, we discuss the problem of facilitating tax auditing assuming
    ``programmable money'',  i.e., digital monetary instruments that are managed by an underlying  distributed ledger. We explore how a taxation
    authority can verify the declared returns of its citizens and create a counterincentive to tax evasion by two distinct mechanisms. 
    First, we describe a design which enables auditing it as a
    built-in feature with minimal changes on the underlying ledger's consensus
    protocol. Second, we offer an application-layer extension, which requires
    no modification in the underlying ledger's design. Both solutions provide a
    high level of privacy, ensuring that, apart from specific limited data
    given to the taxation authority, no additional information --- beyond the
    information already published on the underlying ledger --- is leaked.
